## Introduction

Radiks-server is a pre-built server to index and serve data that lives in decentralized services. Specifically, it is built to index data that is stored in [Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia), and created using the front-end companion library, [radiks.js](https://github.com/hstove/radiks). Because Gaia is just a key-value store, many applications end up needing to store an 'index' of all underlying data, in order to query it in a performant and flexible way.


## Documentation
